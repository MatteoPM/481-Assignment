## Using the System

We strongly recommend visiting the applications hosted page: 
\
https://matteopm.github.io/481-Assignment/ 

You can easily follow the planned walkthroughs from there, as the site is fully functional without requiring any legwork on your end.  

However, the project document mentions "run(ing) from the installation directory" which implies you wish to test this locally.  

To do so, simply clone the repo as you usually would, and navigate to the project directory.\
From here, you can open a shell and type `npm install`.\
Upon that command's completion, you can enter `npm run dev`.\
The terminal will now tell you which port to use when navigating to localhost in your browser, likely `http://localhost:5173`.
